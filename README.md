  ## Description

  In this assignment we are required to create the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code.

  ## Installation

  Before doing the initial installation, the user must install the following npm packages:
  * `express`
  * `mysql`
  * `Sequelize`
  * `dotenv`
  For initial installation, the user is required to enter `mysql -u root -p` on the command line and is then immediately require to enter their password for mysql. Once granted access, the user must enter `source db/schema.sql`. These first steps creates the schema from the mysql shell. After this, enter `npm run seed` to seed the database. Lastly enter run `npm start` which starts the application's server. The user will receive a message notating the port that app is listening at.

  ## Usage

  The needs to use the latest technologies so that the user can compete with other e-commerce companies. In order to do this, we had to configure a working `Express.js` API to use sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.With this app, the user will be able to successfully create, updated, and delete data in the database.
